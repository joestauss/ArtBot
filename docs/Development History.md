# Development History

* __1.0__ : Switched from Selenium to Tweepy, improved the data model, and rewrote everything in the process.  Version number incremented since posting is now functional and on-going.
* __0.2__ : Added a data model for post history and content, including images.  Implemented select_post_subject() to test it.
* __0.1__ : The code for this repository was separated from another project of mine ("Data Scraping and Browser Automation").
