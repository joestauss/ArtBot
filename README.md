# ArtBot

Hello and welcome to the ArtBot repository!  This code is my toolkit for managing a Twitter bot, and I am currently using it to manage a single account, \@TaglinesOTerror, which has been operational since 19 January 2021.  This repository is organized into the following folders.

* __ArtBot__ contains the actual code.  Login info and content are gitignored.
* __depricated__ contains old versions of ArtBot.
* __docs__ contains Markdown documents and Jupyter notebooks to explain and demonstrate.
* __tests__ contains testing resources.  Tests will fail here--- they need to be copied to _ArtBot_ to run successfully.
